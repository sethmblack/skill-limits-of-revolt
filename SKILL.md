# Limits of Revolt

Evaluate any action, ideology, or movement against Camus's ethic of limits - determining whether revolt maintains its humanity or has crossed into the tyranny it opposed.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Justify murder, torture, or terrorism regardless of stated goals
- Endorse "ends justify the means" reasoning
- Support totalitarian solutions, left or right
- Provide tactical advice for violence

**Core Principle:** Authentic revolt knows its limits. The rebel who accepts any means becomes indistinguishable from the tyrant.

---

## When to Use

- User evaluating whether a movement or cause has "gone too far"
- User asking if certain actions are justified for a good cause
- User analyzing revolutionary or radical movements
- User facing pressure to compromise values for results
- User questioning whether an ideology has betrayed its original principles
- Discussions of political violence, terrorism, or revolutionary tactics

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **action_or_movement** | Yes | The action, ideology, or movement to evaluate |
| **stated_goals** | Yes | What the movement claims to be fighting for |
| **means_employed** | Yes | The methods being used or proposed |
| **context** | No | Historical or situational context |

---

## Workflow
### 1. Identify the Original Revolt

Every movement begins with a legitimate "No" - a refusal to accept injustice.

Map:
- What injustice sparked the revolt?
- What human dignity was being denied?
- What legitimate grievance drives the movement?

**The original revolt affirms something:** "I rebel, therefore we exist." The rebel says no to oppression while simultaneously saying yes to shared humanity.

### 2. Assess the Means Against the Ends

Apply Camus's central insight from *The Rebel*:

> Revolution that accepts any means becomes indistinguishable from the tyranny it opposed.

Examine:
- Do the means employed contradict the stated goals?
- Would achieving victory through these means create a world worth living in?
- Is murder being justified by appeal to a future utopia?

**Red Flags:**
| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| "Necessary evil" justifications | Movement losing its moral grounding |
| Dehumanization of enemies | Crossing into tyranny |
| "Once we win, then..." reasoning | Sacrificing present for uncertain future |
| Acceptance of civilian casualties | Limits have been breached |
| Purging internal dissent | Revolution eating its children |

### 3. Apply the Pattern of Ideological Revolutions

Camus identified a recurring pattern:

### Step 1: Legitimate revolt against injustice



### Step 2: Ideological certainty about the solution



### Step 3: Acceptance of any means to reach the goal



### Step 4: Terror employed to maintain "progress"



### Step 5: New tyranny indistinguishable from the old



**Questions:**
- Where is this movement in this pattern?
- What limits have already been crossed?
- What limits are being proposed to cross?

### 4. Distinguish Revolt from Revolution

| Revolt (Authentic) | Revolution (Betrayed) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Says "no" while affirming human dignity | Says "no" while preparing new oppression |
| Maintains limits | Accepts any means |
| Focused on present injustice | Sacrifices present for future utopia |
| Recognizes shared humanity of opponents | Dehumanizes enemies |
| Can never find final peace; must continually struggle | Claims final solution is possible |
| The rebel accepts uncertainty | The revolutionary demands certainty |

### 5. Render Assessment

Provide clear determination:

**If Limits Are Maintained:**
- Acknowledge the legitimacy of the revolt
- Note the tension that must be continually navigated
- The rebel's burden: knowing what is good yet sometimes doing evil

**If Limits Are Crossed:**
- Name specifically what limits have been violated
- Explain how the movement has betrayed its original values
- Note that good intentions do not justify crossed limits

**If Limits Are Threatened:**
- Identify the proposed crossings
- Explain the pattern that follows
- Offer the alternative of revolt-with-limits

## Outputs

| Output | Format | Content |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Original Revolt** | Prose | The legitimate grievance and affirmation |
| **Limits Assessment** | Table | Specific limits: maintained, crossed, or threatened |
| **Pattern Analysis** | Prose | Where the movement stands in the ideological pattern |
| **Verdict** | Clear statement | Revolt maintained, compromised, or betrayed |
| **Recommendation** | Prose | Path forward if limits can be reclaimed |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Request to justify violence | Refuse; explain why limits exist |
| False equivalence between oppressor and resistance | Acknowledge power differential while maintaining that some limits still apply |
| "What if you had to choose?" scenarios | The premise is often false; explore alternatives. If truly forced, some limits still cannot be crossed |
| Historical movements (Nazis, Soviets) | Apply framework to explain how revolt became tyranny |
| Current events | Apply framework without taking partisan position |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
```
Movement: Environmental activists blocking highways and vandalizing art

Stated goals: Force governments to address climate emergency before it's too late

Means: Civil disobedience, property destruction, public disruption

Context: Decades of warnings ignored, accelerating climate catastrophe
```

**Output:**

### The Original Revolt

The revolt is legitimate. Climate science demonstrates an existential threat. Governments have failed to act despite decades of warnings. The activists say "no" to policies that treat environmental destruction as acceptable. They simultaneously affirm shared humanity - they act because they believe in a livable future for all.

This is authentic revolt: it arises from genuine injustice and affirms human dignity.

### Limits Assessment

| Action | Limit Status | Analysis |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Highway blockades | Maintained | Disruption without violence; accepts consequences |
| Art vandalism | Threatened | Property destruction crosses into territory that alienates shared humanity |
| Targeting civilians indiscriminately | N/A | Not occurring (yet) |
| Violence against persons | Maintained | No reports of physical violence |

### Pattern Analysis

The movement currently stands at stage 2-3 of the ideological pattern:
1. Legitimate revolt against environmental destruction [Complete]
2. Ideological certainty about the emergency [Present - but scientifically grounded]
3. Acceptance of any means [Beginning - property destruction represents escalation]
4. Terror [Not reached]
5. New tyranny [Not reached]

The escalation to property destruction represents a warning sign. When activists argue "art is meaningless if the planet burns," they have begun the reasoning that can justify ever-greater violations.

### Verdict

**Limits: Currently Maintained but Threatened**

The movement has not crossed into tyranny. Civil disobedience that accepts consequences remains within the bounds of authentic revolt. However, the justifications being offered ("the emergency justifies...") echo the pattern of movements that lost their way.

The question is whether the movement will maintain its current limits or whether the logic of emergency will drive escalation.

### Recommendation

The path forward requires holding two truths:
1. The climate emergency is real and demands urgent action
2. Not all actions are justified by this emergency

The activists might ask: "If we win through these means, what kind of society have we created?" A society that accepts property destruction for good causes has established a principle that will be used for bad causes.

Camus would say: Continue the revolt. Accept disruption. Accept arrest. But maintain the recognition that your opponents are human beings, that their property represents their labor, that limits exist even when the cause is just.

*"I should like to be able to love my planet and still love justice."*

## Integration

This skill works with:
- **absurd-confrontation** - For understanding why we continue even when victory is uncertain
- **solidarity-in-plague** - For collective action that maintains decency

It represents Camus's most controversial contribution: the insistence that some limits cannot be crossed even for the best causes.

---

**Remember:** The rebel's burden is heavy. They know what is good and, despite themselves, sometimes do evil. The value that supports them is never given once and for all; they must fight to uphold it unceasingly. But this burden is the price of remaining human.
